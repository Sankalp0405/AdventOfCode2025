# Advent of Code 2025 🎄

This repository contains my solutions to **Advent of Code 2025**, an annual series of programming puzzles released daily in December.

I’m using Advent of Code as a way to:

* Improve my **problem-solving skills**
* Get more comfortable writing code outside of class
* Learn how to break down open-ended problems and debug my own solutions

---

## 🧠 Background

* Programming experience: **Introductory computer science coursework (CSC116)**
* Language: **Java**
* Focus: correctness, clarity, and learning — not speed or competition

This repo reflects my learning process, including early attempts, refactors, and improvements over time.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
advent-of-code-2025/
├── day01/
│   ├── Solution.java
│   └── README.md
├── day02/
│   └── Solution.java
├── ...
└── README.md
```

Each day’s folder contains:

* The solution code
* (Optional) notes about my approach and what I learned

---

## 🚀 How I’m Approaching the Problems

* Solving problems **independently first**
* Using documentation and basic references when needed
* Prioritizing readable, well-structured code
* Reflecting on mistakes and lessons learned

---

## ⭐ Notes

* Solutions may not be fully optimized — that’s intentional.
* The goal is steady improvement and deeper understanding.
* Older solutions are kept to show progress over time.
